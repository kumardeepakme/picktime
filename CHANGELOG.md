## 1.0.0-beta

**Added:**

- Now you can specify any element as a "trigger element" for the picker. While doing that you have to specify an input (type text) element in `options` by "`input`" key that would hold the value.
- You can hit `SpaceBar` or `Enter` key on Meridiem (AM/PM) buttons to confirm.

**Documentation:**

- LICENCE.md file updated.
- README.MD file updated.

**Fixed:**

- `input` event conflicted with `keydown` event, which prevented typing/entering numbers in the picker.

## 1.0.0-alpha.0

- Initial alpha release.
